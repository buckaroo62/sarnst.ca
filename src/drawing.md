Again, with Krita and whipping together a quick sketch, that I may or may not continue working on.

I have been playing with this character, on and off for years, trying to get him uglier and uglier. I still have a ways to go making him as ugly as possible, I think.

These are Olaf and Gurnfeld... a couple of characters that I was thinking of for a 3D show that has been rattling around in the back of my mind for a long time. Sort of a histoy show for kids.
