My personal website
Just a personal website to contain my various portfolios for human consumption.
I plan to have a form for someone to contact me and maybe an alternate page with my resume and/or with my erotic drawings on it. 
I build this with 11ty, and an HTML5 Up theme. Added a new background and images... 
I would like to be able to have all of the text in various md files. But again... we'll see.
